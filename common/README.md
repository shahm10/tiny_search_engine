### common

Currently, in common directory we have `pagedir.h` which checks and writes the URL, depth, and HTML in the directory. 
This can be used in `crawler` module to further augment the function.  
### Compilation

To compile, type `make` 
If successful, it creates `common.a` that can be used in crawler.
